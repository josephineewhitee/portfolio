            <p> I'm a 21 year old creative who's ready and excited to take her skills to the professional world.</p>
            <p> I'm all about turning crazy ideas into a reality. Whether it is starting my own entrepreneurial venture or graphic designing - bringing my visions to life is my greatest joy. Growing up, I was that kid who knew exactly what she wanted—seriously, I told my mom I was "the boss" when I was just two years old. I knew exactly what I wanted and had the energy to chase it and that spark has never died. When I set my mind to something, I'll dive into learning whatever it takes to make it happen. Music is basically the soundtrack to my creative hustle—with over 200,000 Spotify minutes each year, you could say it fuels everything I do. Check out what I’ve been listening to below ;)
