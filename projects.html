        <p> As cofounder of the circle, I dabble in a little bit of everything. I spearhead UX design, do comprehensive market research, read case study after case study about strategies successful startups have employed, help with branding strategy, and so much more. As a first time entrepreneur I am doing nothing but learning, learning, and learning some more to make my idea come to life. Exciting things to come in the future! Keep checking in for updates! </p>

        <p> This role was all about creativity, research, and bringing big ideas to life. I dove into local culture to dream up unique music venue concepts, turning them into visually rich postcards that told a story. To help the team make informed decisions, I researched potential locations, broke down competitor venues, and kept us up to date and ahead of the curve with a newsletter about industry trends, pop culture, AI, and more. I even ran an internal video newsletter on industry trends, boosting engagement to 90%. Whether brainstorming immersive experiences or sitting in on agency meetings, I was constantly learning, adapting, and finding new ways to push our ideas further.</p>

        <p> The visionary issue was my brain baby come to life. I truly poured all I had into this issue and am so proud  of how it came out. This role had me juggling everything—designing covers, leading a team, and making sure our magazine actually made it to print. The publication was barely hanging on, so I took on recruitment, quadrupling our team. I pitched themes, ran meetings, and taught design workshops, all while racing against tight deadlines—pulling off last-minute photoshoots, fine-tuning layouts, and editing until the last second. It pushed me to be flexible, wear a million hats, and learn on the fly—skills I’ll carry with me anywhere.</p>

        <p> Black AF was my first issue as a creative director, and I had zero experience going in. I threw myself into learning—leading a team, pitching themes, designing covers, and building a brand. It was fast-paced, hands-on, and constantly evolving, but incredibly rewarding. This issue proved that with a growth mindset, I can learn anything.</p>

         <p>For this event with DJ Anastazja, I was asked to lead the creative visualization team, and I had SO much fun with it. As a huge music lover, I was thrilled to create visuals for such a talented DJ. Before diving in, I researched her brand and past projects to make sure my vision aligned with her style. Using Creative Cloud, I channeled that Boiler Room vibe to design one of my favorite graphics. This project pushed me to level up my Photoshop and Illustrator skills—once I have a vision, I’ll learn whatever it takes to bring it to life. </p>

         <p> I’m obsessed with Abbott Elementary, so you can imagine my excitement when I got this assignment! I dove deep into researching Mekki Lepper and Zack Fox to ensure the design aligned perfectly with their personal brands. Bringing this vision to life meant pushing myself to learn new Photoshop and InDesign techniques, and I didn’t stop until it was just right. The best part? Mekki and Zack called it one of their favorite posters ever!
